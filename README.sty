Here is the rendered 3D visualization of the nitrogenase enzyme's iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co):UntitledClick to open websiteThis 3D model shows the structure of the iron-molybdenum cofactor (FeMo-co), which is the active site of the nitrogenase enzyme. The key components are:

7 iron atoms (orange spheres) arranged in a cubane-like structure
1 molybdenum atom (blue sphere) connected to the iron atoms
Several sulfur atoms (yellow spheres) bridging the iron atoms
Bonds connecting the iron, molybdenum, and sulfur atoms

The cofactor is situated within a simplified representation of the protein environment (semi-transparent blue surface).
You can click and drag to rotate the model and examine it from different angles. The red highlight pulses to indicate the active site where nitrogen fixation occurs.
This visualization helps convey the intricate arrangement of metal atoms that enable nitrogenase to carry out the challenging task of reducing atmospheric nitrogen into bioavailable ammonia. The FeMo-co is essential for this catalytic activity.
Let me know if you have any other questions! I'd be happy to explain more about the structure and function of this fascinating enzyme.
